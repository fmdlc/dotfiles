My personal dotfiles, all in one place.

## Installation

Setup ZSH as your login shell:
``` bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Clone this repository and inside the created directory, execute:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** run the setup snippet if you do not fully understand what it does.
```bah
$: curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmdlc/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

> If you prefer running it manually:
```bash
$: ./bootstrap --dry-run
```
> And if everything is working as expected:
```bash
$: ./bootstrap
```

It will copy all the prefixed `__` files into your `$HOME` directory
